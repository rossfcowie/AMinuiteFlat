# AMinuiteFlat
A simple javascript game.

AMinuiteFlat is a simple javascript game created for the One Minuite Jam on Itch.io (https://itch.io/jam/one-minute-jam)

The objective of the game is to flatten the 5x5 array of boxes so that they all have the same value.  Each game will start by randomly distributing between 1 and 4 of the 50 points to each square across the board.  The player is then given 60 seconds to flatten the board. Left clicking a square will reduce the number on it by one, (right) clicking will increase it by one.
